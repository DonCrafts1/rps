# Rock Paper Scissors
This project was my simple experiment into Java sockets and Swing GUI.
The project contains a server and a client project.
It also utilises a MySQL database to store user account info. If you want to use it, set up a schema named 'UserAccounts' and set up the fields 'username' (VARCHAR), 'password' (VARCHAR), and 'totalWins' (INT).
I have used NetBeans and (most likely) Maven to build and compile this project.

You can modify the project however you want. If you do, leave a like!
