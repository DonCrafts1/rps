# Rock Paper Scissors
This project was my simple experiment into Java sockets and Swing GUI.
The project contains a server and a client project.

The server program has the following features:
- User account data storage (information)
- Simple matchmaking
- Creation of game rooms

The server utilises a MySQL database to store user account information. 
Set up a schema named 'UserAccounts' and create the fields 'username' (VARCHAR), 'password' (VARCHAR), and 'totalWins' (INT), and connect the database to the DatabaseConnection class.

The client program is a simple GUI for the player to see their number of wins and, of course, play the game.

I have used NetBeans and (most likely) Maven to build and compile this project.

You can modify the project however you want. If you do, leave a like!
